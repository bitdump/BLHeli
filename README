This tree contains the BLHeli assembly code for sensorless brushless motor electronic speed control (ESC) boards.
It is designed specifically for use with Eflite mCP X, but may also be used on other copters/planes.

There is one version of the software for Silabs MCU based ESCs, and another for Atmel MCU based ESCs.
