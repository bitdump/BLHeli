;
; The software was initially designed for use with Eflite mCP X, but is now adapted to copters/planes in general
;
; The software was inspired by and started from from Bernard Konze's BLMC: http://home.versanet.de/~bkonze/blc_6a/blc_6a.htm
; And also Simon Kirby's TGY: https://github.com/sim-/tgy
;
; This file is best viewed with tab width set to 5
;
; The input signal can be positive 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz or 12kHz PWM (e.g. taken from the "resistor tap" on mCPx)
; And the input signal can be PPM (1-2ms) or OneShot125 (125-250us) at rates up to several hundred Hz.
; The code adapts itself to the various input modes/frequencies
; The code ESC can also be programmed to accept inverted input signal.
;
; The first lines of the software must be modified according to the chosen environment:
; Uncomment the selected ESC and main/tail/multi mode
; BESCNO EQU "ESC"_"mode"

; Interrupt handling
; The F330/2 does not disable interrupts when entering an interrupt routine.
; Also some interrupt flags need to be cleared by software
; The code disables interrupts in interrupt routines, in order to avoid too nested interrupts
; - Interrupts are disabled during beeps, to avoid audible interference from interrupts
; - RC pulse interrupts are periodically disabled in order to reduce interference with pwm interrupts.
;
;**** **** **** **** ****
; Motor control:
; - Brushless motor control with 6 states for each electrical 360 degrees
; - An advance timing of 0deg has zero cross 30deg after one commutation and 30deg before the next
; - Timing advance in this implementation is set to 15deg nominally
; - "Damped" commutation schemes are available, where more than one pfet is on when pwm is off. This will absorb energy from bemf and make step settling more damped.
; Motor sequence starting from zero crossing:
; - Timer wait: Wt_Comm			15deg	; Time to wait from zero cross to actual commutation
; - Timer wait: Wt_Advance		15deg	; Time to wait for timing advance. Nominal commutation point is after this
; - Timer wait: Wt_Zc_Scan		7.5deg	; Time to wait before looking for zero cross
; - Scan for zero cross			22.5deg	, Nominal, with some motor variations
;
; Motor startup:
; Startup is the only phase, before normal bemf commutation run begins.
