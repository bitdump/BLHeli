This tree contains the BLHeli assembly code for sensorless brushless motor electronic speed control (ESC) boards.
It is designed specifically for use with Eflite mCP X, but may also be used on other copters/planes.

This tree contains SiLabs assembly code for SiLabs MCU based ESCs. 

Features and Changes
--------------------
- Can be configured for main motor or tail motor operation
- Main motor operation has governor functionality
- Tail motor operation can be damped for fast motor retardation
- Many parmeters can be programmed from the TX
- Supports 1kHz, 2kHz, 4kHz or 8kHz positive or negative pwm as input signal

Supported Hardware
------------------
- DP 3A
- Supermicro 3.5A
- XP 3A
- XP 7A
- XP 12A
- Turnigy 6A

Installation and use
--------------------
The software is written and debugged in the SiLabs IDE.
Compilation is done using Raisonance Ride7 and Rkit-51 toolchain.
