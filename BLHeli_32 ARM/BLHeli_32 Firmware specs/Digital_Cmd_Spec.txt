Commands are only executed when motors are stopped
Note that throttle has to be zero, and the telemetry bit must be set in the command frames.
Also note that a significant delay (several hundred ms) may be needed between commands.

Commands are valid for Dshot and Proshot input signals

ESC_INFO layout for BLHeli_32:
1-12: ESC SN
13: Indicates which response version is used. 254 is for BLHeli_32 version.
14: FW revision (32 = 32)
15: FW sub revision (10 = xx.1, 11 = xx.11)
16: Unused
17: Rotation direction reversed by dshot command or not (1:0)
18: 3D mode active or not (1:0)
19: Low voltage protection limit [0.1V] (255 = not capable, 0 = disabled)
20: Current protection limit [A] (255 = not capable, 0 = disabled)
21: LED0 on or not (1:0, 255 = LED0 not present)
22: LED1 on or not (1:0, 255 = LED1 not present)
23: LED2 on or not (1:0, 255 = LED2 not present)
24: LED3 on or not (1:0, 255 = LED3 not present)
25-31: Unused
32-63: ESC signature
64: CRC (same CRC as is used for telemetry)
